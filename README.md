## Features

This addon enables the following pattern:

```js
// some-component
export default Component.extend(RequiredProperties, {
  requiredProperties: ['thing', 'another', 'on-select-thing']  
});
```

```hbs
{{some-component}}
```

```sh
ERROR: You must provide `thing`, `another`, and `on-select-thing` to {{some-component}}.
```

Like `ember-prop-types`, this addon helps ensure required properties are passed to components. This addon is intended to be a much smaller building block. It only verifies required properties are present, not that they are of the correct type.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-required-properties
```

## Usage

Import the mixin anywhere you want to require properties:

```js
import RequiredProperties from 'ember-required-properties/mixins/required-properties';

export Component.extend(RequiredProperties, {
  requiredProperties: ['one', 'two']
});
```

Now if you fail to pass all of the required properties you will get an error.

NOTE: since we use `Ember.assert` to throw errors, production will silently fail.
